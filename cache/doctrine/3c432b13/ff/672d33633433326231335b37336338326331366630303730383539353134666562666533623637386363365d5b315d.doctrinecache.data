<p>The first thing you should do in this stage is to create a test plan, it doesn’t have to be fancy. <p>The 'what' that is being tested is some kind of prototype or maybe just items that you want sorted by a user.</p></p>

<details><summary>Testing Tips</summary>
<ul>
    <li>Be an open-minded, unbiased observer</li>
    <li>Don’t ask guided questions and don’t tell the user what to do</li>
    <li>Don’t be afraid of negative feedback, it is better to know what is wrong and fix it rather than implement a poor idea and waste time and money</li>
    <li>Results of testing can send you back to Empathize or any other stage, that’s okay</li>

<h4>Card Sorting</h4>
<p><br></p>

<h4>A/B Testing</h4>
<p>A/B testing is a simple testing technique used to test multiple versions of a product or service. </p>
<ul>
<li>The current version may be compared to a modified version</li>
<li>Two new versions may be compared to each other</li>
<li>It is usually used to determine the user’s preference with regard to one feature
<br>
<hr>
<h4>Usability Testing</h4>
<p>Also referred to as usability task testing is a type of task-based testing. The test is centred around the user’s ability to complete a given task. Some examples of tasks are:</p></li>
<li>Complete sign-up and log-in for a website</li>
<li>Use the toast-bagel feature on a toaster</li>
<li>Leave feedback using a contact form</li>
</ul>
<h5>Preparing for Usability testing</h5>
<ul>
<li>Identify tasks you would like to test and create expected user flows for them.</li>
<li>Select users, a test venue and time</li>
<li>Get your prototypes or product ready</li>
<li>Assign a scribe, facilitator and if necessary, a ‘computer’ </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>How to conduct a usability test</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>The facilitator provides the user with general background information about the product</li>
    <li>The facilitator answers any questions user may have</li>
    <li>The facilitator provides the user with a task to complete, verbally or written down</li>
    <li>The user says what has to be done, if there is a person acting as a computer they may perform the actions and swap out screens etc</li>
    <li>The scribe takes note of all the user’s actions, what they clicked on, where they hesitated</li>
    <li>The facilitator may ask for general feedback at the end or briefly during the completion of the task</li>
</ul>
