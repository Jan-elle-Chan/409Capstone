During the define stage you will use the information gathered from the Empathize stage to help define the user problem. 
The problem statement you develop will be used to drive the Ideation stage.


By now you will have a clear understanding of who the user is, what they want to accomplish, and what their pain points are.

> **_NOTE:_** _A pain point is any obstruction, issue or challenge faced by the user in their attempt to accomplish their goal. Pain points present you with opportunities, in that they can be addressed in your solution, increasing its value to the user._

User personas
A user persona is a representation of your target audience that you have made up based on data collected. 
It must consider 
Who are they? – general background about user
What are their goals – what they want to accomplish, what information do they want to find, service or product
What are their pain points – challenges with accomplishing their goal

The persona can include the following sections:
Name
Picture
Quote
Short biography
Background
Needs
Goals or objectives
Pain points or challenges
Behaviours
Skills – communication, technological, or related to product
Products used
Demographics
 
Examples of User Personas
Persona for the Comox Valley Search and Rescue. Users visit the website to:
Learn about outdoor and adventure safety
Learn about becoming a member of CVSR
 
Persona for Reduce. Users are:
Younger, technologically oriented people who are environmentally conscious
Want to find ways to track and reduce their carbon dioxide output.
 



User Stories
User stories are statements written from someone’s point of view. Most of the time the ‘someone’ is a user but it can also be another stakeholder. They summarise what the user wants to achieve. 

As a _____ I want to _____ so that I can _____

User story examples

Toy library: As a parent I want to access exchangeable toys so that I can provide novel experiences for my toddler to fit by budget

Search and Rescue: As an outdoor adventure guide I want to learn about search and rescue guidelines and area-specific news to have safe group outings.

Reduce App: As a global citizen I want to be able to keep track of how much carbon dioxide I am producing so I be reassured that the steps I have been taking to help the environment have been working.



User stories are
informal 
goal-oriented
written in natural language

User stories Do Not
describe a software feature
explain how the goal will be achieved



Point of View Statements
Point of View statements describe the user’s needs. 
They are similar to user stories
They describe a challenge as a problem statement
Are actionable statements 
Have a narrow focus

Point of View Statement Examples

A department supervisor needs a way to have meetings with department members who work across various shifts because having everyone’s input into how the department runs can improve its efficiency.


How Might We Questions
A single POV statement may generate several How Might We questions. 

How Might  We questions 
Short questions that focus on some aspect of the POV
Intended to spark idea generation in the Ideate stage
Break down the POV – the user, needs, reason
Try formulating a question around each
Try out different verbs with each to get different questions
Don’t be scared to take the HMWs back to Empathize and use them as interview questions (iteration!)


Here are some example using the POV from the previous section. Notice they do not all focus on getting a meeting organised but focus on the goals as well: getting everyone’s input and making the department more efficient.
How might we improve department efficiency?
How might we get department members’ input on running the department?
How might we arrange department meetings to include all members?




The first HMW above could have used a different verb that led to a different question entirely and a different stream of ideas
How might we measure department efficiency?
How can we sustain department efficiency?
