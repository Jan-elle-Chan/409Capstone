The first thing you should do in this stage is to create a test plan, it doesn’t have to be fancy. <p>The 'what' that is being tested is some kind of prototype or maybe just items that you want sorted by a user.</p>
* Who are the users
* What is being tested
* When
* What is needed


<details><summary>Testing Tips</summary>
<ul>
	<li>Be an open-minded, unbiased observer</li>
	<li>Don’t ask guided questions and don’t tell the user what to do</li>
	<li>Don’t be afraid of negative feedback, it is better to know what is wrong and fix it rather than implement a poor idea and waste time and money</li>
	<li>Results of testing can send you back to Empathize or any other stage, that’s okay</li>
</ul>

### Testing Techniques
* Card Sorting
* A/B Testing
* Usability Testing

#### Card Sorting

#### A/B Testing
A/B testing is a simple testing technique used to test multiple versions of a product or service. 
* The current version may be compared to a modified version
* Two new versions may be compared to each other
* It is usually used to determine the user’s preference with regard to one feature 
<br>

#### Usability Testing
Also referred to as usability task testing is a type of task-based testing. The test is centred around the user’s ability to complete a given task. Some examples of tasks are:
* Complete sign-up and log-in for a website
* Use the toast-bagel feature on a toaster
* Leave feedback using a contact form

##### Preparing for Usability testing
* Identify tasks you would like to test and create expected user flows for them.
* Select users, a test venue and time
* Get your prototypes or product ready
* Assign a scribe, facilitator and if necessary, a ‘computer’ 

<details><summary>How to conduct a usability test</summary>
 <ul>
	<li>The facilitator provides the user with general background information about the product</li>
	<li>The facilitator answers any questions user may have</li>
	<li>The facilitator provides the user with a task to complete, verbally or written down</li>
	<li>The user says what has to be done, if there is a person acting as a computer they may perform the actions and swap out screens etc</li>
	<li>The scribe takes note of all the user’s actions, what they clicked on, where they hesitated</li>
	<li>The facilitator may ask for general feedback at the end or briefly during the completion of the task</li>
</ul>
