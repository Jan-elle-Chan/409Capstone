<p>The first thing you should do in this stage is to create a test plan, it doesn’t have to be fancy: </p>
<ul>
<li>Who are the users</li>
<li>What is being tested</li>
<li>When</li>
<li>What is needed
<p>The 'what' that is being tested is some kind of prototype or maybe just items that you want sorted by a user.</p></li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Testing Tips</summary>
<ul>
    <li>Be an open-minded, unbiased observer</li>
    <li>Don’t ask guided questions and don’t tell the user what to do</li>
    <li>Don’t be afraid of negative feedback, it is better to know what is wrong and fix it rather than implement a poor idea and waste time and money</li>
    <li>Results of testing can send you back to Empathize or any other stage, that’s okay</li>
</ul>
