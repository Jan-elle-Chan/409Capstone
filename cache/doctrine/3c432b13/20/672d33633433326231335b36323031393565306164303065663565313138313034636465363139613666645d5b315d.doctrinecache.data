<p>The first thing you should do in this stage is to create a test plan, it doesn’t have to be fancy: who are the users, what is being tested, when, what is needed. The 'what' that is being tested is some kind of prototype or maybe just items that you want sorted by a user.</p>
<details><summary>Testing Tips</summary>
<ul>
    <li>Be an open-minded, unbiased observer</li>
    <li>Don’t ask guided questions and don’t tell the user what to do</li>
    <li>Don’t be afraid of negative feedback, it is better to know what is wrong and fix it rather than implement a poor idea and waste time and money</li>
    <li>Results of testing can send you back to Empathize or any other stage, that’s okay</li>
</ul>
