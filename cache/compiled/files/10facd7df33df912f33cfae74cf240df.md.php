ReduCe is intended to help users make a positive impact on the environment by providing them with information that reduces their carbon footprint. It does this by calculating the user\'s daily carbon-dioxide output based on their daily tasks.
Apart from providing the user with alternatives to their daily routing that will output less carbon-dioxide, ReduCe also reports users daily, weekly and monthly output so they can monitor their output over time.


### Define
