## What is Design thinking?

Design thinking is an approach to problem-solving and innovation. It is a user-centric approach which focuses on the solution. 

<hr>

Design thinking has five (5) stages: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test
<ol>
    <li>Empathize - In this stage you try to understand the user and their needs by gathering information</li>
    <li>Define – Based on discoveries made during the empathize stage you will define the user problem</li>
    <li>Ideate – With the problem statement in mind, come up with as many ideas as possible, later in this stage, you will evaluate the ideas</li>
    <li>Prototype – create a model of the intended solution, it can be a paper version or something more complex, but you must be mindful it can be discarded</li>
    <li>Test – In this stage you will have users interact with your prototype and collect feedback for improvements and further iteration</li>
</ol>

<p>Although the stages are generally followed in order the process may be non-linear, meaning any stage can be done at any time, it would look more like the diagram below not above. </p>

<p>The process is also iterative, it may be completed then repeated or there may be iteration within the stages as well, allowing for deeper exploration.</p>

<details><summary>Design Thinking vs UX Design</summary>
    <p>UX design is the design of products and services that provide the user with meaningful, enjoyable and seamless user experiences.</p> 

<p>Design Thinking is a problem-solving framework which can be applied to any type of problem, and is particularly useful for complex problems.</p>

<p>Creating user experiences as described in the first paragraph above, is a problem designers face and Design Thinking is ONE framework which can be used to solve them.</p>

<p>Simply put UX Design is a broad field of study and practice and Design Thinking is a problem-solving approach. The one thing key thing they have in common is that they are both user-centric.</p>
